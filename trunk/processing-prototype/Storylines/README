 This readme accompanies the prototype of the Software Evolution Storylines
 project. It visualizes interactions between software developers through their
 repository commits.

== Instructions ==

=== Prerequisites ===

 This software is written in Processing.
  - Download at http://processing.org

 You will need to have the JUNG toolkit installed in your Java classpath.
  - Download at http://jung.sourceforge.net

=== Data ===

 This project uses the same XML data format as code_swarm. You can see an
 example of it with the "data/sample-repevents.xml" file. Most people need to
 convert their version control system log data into the XML format. This can be
 done with the conversion script that comes with the Python project.
  - Download the Python converter script at http://code.google.com/p/codeswarm/
  - It is located in "trunk/convert_logs/convert_logs.py"

=== Config Files ===

 Before running the program, you must have a config file which specifies the
 parameters like data file location, image size, export format, etc.
  - Copy the "config/sample.config" file and rename it to something that
    describes your project.
  - Edit the copy and change the necessary parameters.

=== Running ===

 Open the Processing environment and load Storylines.pde file.

 Change the variable CONFIG_FILE (towards the top of Storylines.pde) to point
 to your config file.

 Run the program.
